# PPN-microbench
A portable microbenchmarking tool for compute node caracterisation.

# Architecture support
This tool is (currently) developed and tested for **64-bit Arm and x86 architectures.**

## GPUs
Also being aimed at GPUs, the tool with execute benchmarks using [HIP](https://github.com/ROCm/HIP). If it is not available on the host, all GPU related benchmarks will be entirely skipped during compilation.

# Benchmarks
Below is a list of currently implemented benchmarks; detailed information is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/ppn-microbench/ppn-microbench/wiki).

| Benchmark             | Description                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU frequency         | CPU clock frequency in single- and multi-core light workloads                                     |
| CPU OPS               | Peak integer & floating-point operations per second for 32-, 64-bit and SIMD arithmetic workloads |
| Core-to-core latency  |Â Latency of core-to-core communications                                                            |
| Cache latency         | Latency of different cache level accesses                                                         |
| Host to GPU bandwidth | Bandwidth of host to GPU memory transfer                                                          |

# Running

## Via the run script
The simplest way to run the application is from the `run` script. Upon executing it, a pdf will be output to `report/out/` containing results for all benchmarks.

The `run` script executes the following steps:
1. Build the application
2. Run the application
3. Creat a python vitrual environment if none exists
4. Generate a PDF report from the application output

If you have an earlier version of Python, you might need to install `python<version>-venv` through your package manager.

## Manually

### Building
In order to build the application, run the following commands:

```bash
# -G Ninja drastically improves build times
cmake -B build [-G Ninja]
cmake --build build/
```

The executable will be located in `build/main/`.

### Running
You can now simply run the executable. Note that by default, the JSON will be dumped to `./`.

### Report generation
To generate the PDF report, move into `report/`. The Python script expects to find the JSON results in `report/out.json`.

`mathplotlib` and `weasypring` are the only required Python packages. You can install both dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Finally, running the Python script is as easy as `python3 main.py`

## Arguments
It is possible to run individual/groups of benchmarks by passing arguments directly to the Python script or C++ application:

| argument              | alias | description                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--debug`             | `-d`  | Sets logging level to debug, showing extra information on screen                   |
| `--output`            | `-o`  | Sets output file name and location. can be either a directory or a full file path  |
| `--cpu-frequency`     |       | Adds the CPU frequency benchmark for execution                                     |
| `--ops`               |       | Adds the CPU OPS benchmark for execution                                           |
| `--c2c`               |       | Adds the CPU core to core latency benchmark for execution                          |
| `--cache-latency`     |       | Adds the Cache latency benchmark for execution                                     |
| `--gpu-h2d-bandwidth` |       | Adds the GPU host to device memory bandwidth benchmark for execution               |
| `--cpu`               |       | Adds all cpu-related benchmarks to the pool. (CPU Frequency, CPU OPS, C2C lat.)    |
| `--mem`               |       | Adds all memory-related benchmarks to the pool. (Cache latency)                    |
| `--gpu`               |       | Adds all GPU-related benchmarks to the pool. (gpu h2d bandwidth)                   |

If no benchmark is explicitly specified, all of them will be run.
